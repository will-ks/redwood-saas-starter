# Compliance

Documentation related to data protection / security compliance matters

## GDPR / DPA 2018

As a company operating in the EU we need to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Compliance with the GDPR should make us compliant with the UK's Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), which is largely the same.

## Security

We should of course aim to implement securiry best practices.
