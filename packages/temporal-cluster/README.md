# temporal-cluster

A Temporal Cluster is the group of services, known as the Temporal ServerLink preview icon, combined with persistence
stores, that together act as a component of the Temporal Platform.

The Temporal Cluster (including the Temporal Cloud) doesn't execute any of your code (Workflow and
Activity Definitions) on Temporal Cluster machines. The Cluster is solely responsible for orchestrating state
transitions and providing Tasks to the next available Worker Entity.
